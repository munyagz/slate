<p><strong>Built for mission-critical use</strong>: Miners, service providers, and exchanges need fast synchronisation and maximum uptime. Parity Ethereum provides the core infrastructure essential for speedy and reliable services.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean, modular codebase for easy customisation</li>
<li>Advanced CLI-based client</li>
<li>Minimal memory and storage footprint</li>
<li>Synchronise in hours, not days with Warp Sync</li>
<li>Modular for light integration into your service or product</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='technical-overview'>Technical Overview</h2>
<p>Parity Ethereum&#39;s goal is to be the fastest, lightest, and most secure Ethereum client. We are developing Parity Ethereum using the sophisticated and cutting-edge <strong>Rust programming language</strong>. Parity Ethereum is licensed under the GPLv3 and can be used for all your Ethereum needs.</p>

<p>By default, Parity Ethereum runs a JSON-RPC HTTP server on port <code>:8545</code> and a Web-Sockets server on port <code>:8546</code>. This is fully configurable and supports a number of APIs.</p>

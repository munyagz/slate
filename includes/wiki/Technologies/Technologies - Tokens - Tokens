<p>The native token of the Ethereum blockchain is called <em>Ether</em> (ETH). In addition to Ether, additional assets and tokens can be handled by the Ethereum blockchain. The Parity Ethereum wallet supports any <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20">ERC20</a>-compliant token by displaying balances and enabling transfers to be as simple as Ether transactions.</p>

<p>To get your first tokens, and learn how to use them, you can use the <strong>GavCoin</strong> DApp. Open the <strong>Applications</strong> tab, enable the network applications, and open GavCoin. If it&#39;s not displayed by default, make sure to confirm the usage warning for community DApps and use the <em>Edit</em> button on top to toggle visibility of displayed DApps.</p>

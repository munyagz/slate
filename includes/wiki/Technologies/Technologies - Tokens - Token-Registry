<p>In a previous article on <a href="Token-Deployment.md">Token Deployment</a>, we created <em>Teh Coin</em> [TEH]. Now, creating your own <a href="Tokens.md">token</a> is a nice thing to do. However, it would be nice if <em>all</em> Parity Ethereum users could see and use your token in the wallet by default. Therefore, we need to register our token with the <strong>Token Registry</strong> DApp. Navigate to Applications in your wallet and find the Token Registry. If it&#39;s not displayed by default, use the <em>Edit</em> button on top to toggle visibility of displayed DApps.</p>

<em>Figure: To register a new token with the <strong>Token Registry</strong>, we need the token address, decide on a 3-letter acronym (TLA), a token name, and specify the number of decimals (between <code>0</code> and <code>18</code>).</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/./images/dapps-tokendeploy-6.png" alt="dapps-tokendeploy-6" />
<em>Figure: Once done, this will execute the <code>register</code> function of the Token Registry smart contract adding our token to Parity. Note, there is a fee of <code>0.01</code> ETH to register a token.</em></p>

<em>Figure: Once deployed, the token is displayed in the registry among other registered tokens.</em></p>

<p>Finally, we need an icon for our token to be displayed in the wallet. This can be done by adding meta data to the token registry contract.</p>

<p><img src="/images/./images/dapps-tokendeploy-9.png" alt="dapps-tokendeploy-9" />
<em>Figure: To add an icon we have to click <strong>Add Metadata</strong> and provide the static URL to the image file.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/./images/dapps-tokendeploy-a.png" alt="dapps-tokendeploy-a" />
<em>Figure: Adding an icon triggers two transactions: The first one is generating a hint for the <a href="Parity-Github-Hint">URL registry</a> and the second one is setting the hint as token metadata.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/./images/dapps-tokendeploy-b.png" alt="dapps-tokendeploy-b" />
<em>Figure: Once both transactions are mined, we can look-up the image on the token registry DApp.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/./images/dapps-tokendeploy-c.png" alt="dapps-tokendeploy-c" />
<em>Figure: And our custom token will be displayed along with other tokens in our wallet, note the shiny icon.</em></p>

<p>Any token registered with the Parity Token Registry will be automatically visibile to all Parity wallet users holding tokens or watching accounts with registered tokens.</p>

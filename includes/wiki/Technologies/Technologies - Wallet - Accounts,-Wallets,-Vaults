<p>The parity wallet offers multiple options to store tokens and Ether.</p>
<h3 id='accounts'>Accounts</h3>
<p>Accounts are the most <strong>basic way to store assets</strong>. They consist of simple public/private key-pairs, which are used to sign transactions, enable authentication, and prove ownership.</p>

<p><img src="/images/accounts-0.png" alt="accounts-0" /></p>

<p>To create an account with the <a href="Parity-Wallet">Parity Wallet</a>, open the <em>Accounts</em> tab, click the <code>+ACCOUNT</code> button, and follow the instructions. Make sure to write down your recovery phrase in a secure location and to create <a href="Backing-up-&amp;-Restoring">backups</a> of your private key after account creation.</p>
<h3 id='wallets'>Wallets</h3>
<p>Wallets are smart contracts which manage assets and can be owned by multiple accounts. Unlike accounts, contract wallets are controlled by code, which means that it is possible to customize their behavior. The most common use-case are <strong>multi-signature wallets</strong>, that allow for transaction logging, withdrawal limits, and rule-sets for signatures required.</p>

<p>Parity only allows to watch wallets and interract with them (view and sign transactions, send funds..). It does not allow to create multi-sig wallets.
To watch a multi-sig wallet within Parity UI, open the <em>Accounts</em> tab, click on the <code>+WALLET</code> button and select <em>Watch a Wallet</em>.</p>

<h3 id='vaults'>Vaults</h3>
<p>Vaults are an additional privacy feature to lock away your accounts behind a second layer of encryption. While your normal accounts are encrypted with your pass-phrase, their meta-data is accessible for all applications interacting with your wallet. Creating <strong>a vault encrypts the meta-data</strong> (e.g., the public address) and therefore hides the accounts until you unlock the vault.</p>

<p><img src="/images/accounts-vault-1.png" alt="accounts-vault-1" /></p>

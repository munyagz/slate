<p>It&#39;s generally sensible to back up your keys and recovery phrases.</p>
<h3 id='role-of-parity-recovery-phrases'>Role of Parity recovery phrases</h3>
<p>The Parity recovery phrase is a 12-word mnemonic phrase allowing you to have an additional backup. It&#39;s displayed once after account creation and should be written down or printed out and kept in a safe place. This phrase is not protected with any password or encryption and should always kept offline and <em>cold</em>. In the rare case that your encrypted backups (see below) are corrupted or lost, the phrase allows you to fully recover your private key.</p>
<h3 id='exporting-accounts-via-the-wallet-ui'>Exporting accounts via the Wallet UI</h3>
<p>The most convenient way to backup your accounts is via the wallet UI which offers direct export of the encrypted key files in JSON format.</p>
<h5 id='a-single-account'>A single account</h5>
<p>To backup a single account, just open your accounts view, click the account you wish to export, and find the <strong>EXPORT</strong> button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/accounts-export-0.png" alt="accounts-export-0" />
<em>Once you enter your passphrase and confirm, the key will be exported and downloaded to your disk.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/accounts-export-1.png" alt="accounts-export-1" />
<em>The backup is a password-encrypted JSON-file.</em></p>
<h5 id='all-accounts-at-once'>All accounts at once</h5>
<p>To backup multiple accounts, or all accounts at once, just open your accounts view and find the <strong>EXPORT</strong> button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/accounts-export-2.png" alt="accounts-export-2" />
<em>Toggle which accounts you wish to export by clicking them, and thus enabling or disabling the account export.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/accounts-export-3.png" alt="accounts-export-3" />
<em>Enter the password for each account you wish to export and confirm.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/accounts-export-4.png" alt="accounts-export-4" />
<em>The backup is a set of password-encrypted JSON-files stored to your disk.</em></p>
<h3 id='exporting-accounts-via-cli'>Exporting accounts via CLI</h3>
<p>If the wallet UI is not available or not desired, keys can be backed up via JSON-RPC API or by manually copying and archiving the files.</p>
<h5 id='available-rpc-apis'>Available RPC APIs</h5>
<p>The <code>parity_exportAccount</code> is exactly designed to retrieve the password-encrypted JSON backup via RPC.</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl --data <span class="s1">'{"method":"parity_exportAccount","params":["0x007d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1","hunter2"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'</span> -H <span class="s2">"Content-Type: application/json"</span> -X POST localhost:8545
</code></pre>
<p>The required parameters are the account to export and the password used to protect it.</p>
<h5 id='manual-archiving-via-cli'>Manual archiving via CLI</h5>
<p>Via CLI, this is simply a case of copying a particular directory. Here&#39;s how you can do it...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>on Mac:
<code>bash
cd $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/io.parity.ethereum/keys &amp;&amp; tar czf $HOME/Desktop/parity-keys-backup.tgz *
</code></p></li>
<li><p>on Linux:
<code>bash
cd $HOME/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/keys &amp;&amp; tar czf $HOME/Desktop/parity-keys-backup.tgz *
</code></p></li>
<li><p>on Windows, the key folder can be found at <code>%HOMEPATH%/AppData/Roaming/Parity/Ethereum/keys</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will get a file <code>parity-keys-backup.tgz</code> in your <code>Desktop</code> path (which should therefore show up on your desktop). You can move it wherever you want - a USB pen drive might be sensible.</p>
<h3 id='backing-up-wallets-and-vaults'>Backing up wallets and vaults</h3>
<p>To backup a simple contract wallet or multi-signature wallet, all you need to do is to remember the public address, and - of course - having backups of the associated owner accounts (see above for instructions).</p>

<p>To backup a complete vault, just backup the full directory containing the <code>vault.json</code> and all encrypted key files to a secure location. This directory is a sub-directory of your keys path, usually named after your vault.</p>
<h3 id='restoring-options'>Restoring options</h3>
<p>Restoring options work analogue to the backup options explained above.</p>
<h5 id='wallet-ui'>Wallet UI</h5>
<p>The user interface allows you to <strong>import</strong> keys from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Geth Keystore: This allows importing keys created in with the go-ethereum client.</li>
<li>JSON Backup: This allows importing password-encrypted JSON key-files previously exported with Parity.</li>
<li>Private Keys: This allows importing plain, unencrypted private keys generated with any other application.</li>
<li>Presale Wallet: This allows importing a wallet from the initial Ether pre-sale maintained by the Ethereum Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, it&#39;s possible to <strong>restore</strong> private keys from the 12-word mnemonic recovery phrase.</p>
<h5 id='command-line'>Command line</h5>
<p>To restore from a previous CLI backup...</p>

<ul>
<li>on Mac:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/Library/Application Support/io.parity.ethereum/keys <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> tar xzf <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/Desktop/parity-keys-backup.tgz <span class="k">*</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>on Linux:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.local/share/io.parity.ethereum/keys <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> tar xzf <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/Desktop/parity-keys-backup.tgz <span class="k">*</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This assumes our previously created backup is located on your Desktop.</p>

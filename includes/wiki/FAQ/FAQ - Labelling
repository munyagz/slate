<p>This page is to explain the conventions over Parity&#39;s labeling system.</p>

<p>Labels are split into several groups.</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;A&#39; group is used for code-review status and are applicable only to Pull Requests.</li>
<li>&#39;B&#39; group is used for pull requests for upcoming beta releases.</li>
<li>&#39;F&#39; group is used to encode the type (and accordingly the severity) of issues; they are applicable only within the Issue Tracker.</li>
<li>&#39;M&#39; group is to encode the affected component or sub-project.</li>
<li>&#39;P&#39; group is to denote priority. They are generally relevant only to issues, though may in principle be used on pull-requests.</li>
<li>&#39;Q&#39; group is to denote difficulty.</li>
<li>&#39;Z&#39; group are reasons for why something is a non-issue. They are applicable only within the Issue Tracker.</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, a pull request must have a single label from the &#39;A&#39; group and may additionally have a single label from the &#39;P&#39; group (though typically will not).</p>

<p>An valid issue must have a single label from the &#39;F&#39; group and may additionally have a single label from the &#39;P&#39; group. An invalid issue should be closed with a single label from the &#39;Z&#39; group.</p>
<h3 id='39-a-39-group'>&#39;A&#39; group</h3>
<p>All pull requests should start labeled with either &#39;A0-pleasereview&#39;, &#39;A3-inprogress&#39;, &#39;A8-backport&#39; (in the base of an already-reviewed back-port), or &#39;A2-insubstantial&#39; (should it be an alteration which requires no code review). After review it should be relabeled with another &#39;A&#39; group label.</p>

<ul>
<li><img src="http://i.imgur.com/8lr1M4r.png" alt="A0-pleasereview" /> Pull request needs code review.</li>

<li><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xPahkpz.png" alt="A2-insubstantial" /> Pull request requires no code review (e.g. a sub-repository hash update).</li>
<li><img src="http://i.imgur.com/rQbszDc.png" alt="A3-inprogress" /> Pull request is in progress. No review needed at this stage.</li>
<li><code>A3-stale</code> Pull request did not receive any updates in a long time. No review needed at this stage and should be closed if author does not indicate any further work is done.</li>

<li><img src="http://i.imgur.com/fD1vO9N.png" alt="A5-grumble" /> Pull request has minor issues that must be addressed before merging. This may require only replying to comments. Pull request should be relabeled as <code>A0-pleasereview</code> to get a final sign-off from a reviewer.</li>
<li><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hGDrT93.png" alt="A6-mustntgrumble" /> Pull request has areas for improvement. The author need not address them before merging.</li>
